At times, we think about the question, how exactly the data is stored in the backend and retrieved back in the same format. The answer to this is **Data Structures**.\n",

Essentially, it happens when the current value has the data as well as the address of the next value.\n",

This form of data is non-sequential. Hence, it has to be stored in a non-linear data structure, which along with the data stores the relation of the data on the higher and lower level. \n",
